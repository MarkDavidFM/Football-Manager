File for Holme FC 3d Kits
Hello,
So you want a folder creating somewhere like C:\Users\YOURNAMEHERE\Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2019\graphics\kits\Holme FC 3d
Inside that folder you should put each of the images I sent you, they should be named HolmeHome.png HolmeAway.png and HolmeThird.png.
Also in the folder place the config.xml I placed in here. 
If there are any problems once you boot the game and refresh your skin and reload all everything. Chances are I've messed up the club ID in the XML
That's easy fixed though, open the XML in notepad and just edit the obviously long number with the right one. I think it's right though.

After that .. it should all be done.
